# Flow matching against UVCGAN-S on the sPHENIX decomposition

Started 2026-09-24. Branch `ddp` of `github.com/Shuonli/uvcgan-s`. The
scaling notes (`SCALING_NOTES.md`) hold the baseline's training and its
held-out scores; this file holds the flow-matching comparison.

Questions: can a flow-based model reach the current UVCGAN-S physics
performance in fewer GPU-hours; is it more stable across seeds; how do final
quality and inference cost compare. Treated as hypotheses.

## Pre-registration (written before any flow model was trained)

### The task, as it actually is

The active configuration (`scripts/train/sphenix/train_uvcgan-s.py`) is
**mixture-to-components decomposition**, not equal-dimensional translation:

- towers: 24 (eta) x 64 (phi) calorimeter images in GeV, no noise;
- `gen_ba` maps a 1-channel mixture (PYTHIA jet embedded in central HIJING,
  domain `embed`) to 2 channels (background, signal); `gen_ab` maps them back;
- data norm `log`, bias 0.1: psi(E) = log(E + 0.1);
- training data, sampled independently (`merge_type` unpaired): 986k HIJING
  background events, 2.64M PYTHIA signal events, 633k mixed events. Val:
  200k mixed events; test: 833k JEWEL-in-HIJING mixed events.
- inference network: `ema_gen_ba` (the EMA of `gen_ba`), 1 forward pass.

### Audit of what the baseline learns from

- No hidden correspondence: the three domains are shuffled independently.
- **Synthetic pairs are already used.** The `idt-aa` term feeds
  `gen_ba` the sum `real_a0 + real_a1` of an independently drawn background
  and signal and penalises the L1 distance (GeV, weights 2.5 and 25) of its
  output to those two images: supervised training on synthetic mixtures,
  built from the known additive mixing. The `idt-bb` term embeds a real
  mixture as (mixture, 0) in the component domain.
- Real mixtures enter through `cyc-bab` (decompose, remix, L1 to the input)
  and the three adversarial losses.
- Held-out truth (the (file, event) pairing of the index files) is used
  only by `scripts/slurm/eval_val_truth.py`. Caveat carried over: the val
  events' signal images are among the unpaired training signals.

So a candidate may use synthetic mixtures b + s of independently drawn
events without using more information than the baseline; it may not use the
index files or any val/test event.

### Metric, tolerance and targets

Primary metric: `jer_cal`, the calibrated jet energy resolution on the fixed
20k val events (17,542 jets) of `eval_val_truth.py`. Also recorded:
`l1_sig`, `l1_bkg`, `jes`, `bias`. JEWEL (`--truth jewel`) is reserved
for the final evaluation of checkpoints selected on val.

Tolerances, measured before any candidate existed: statistical error of
`jer_cal` 0.028 GeV (bootstrap of the published model's jets); paired
difference of two similar models on the same events 0.006 GeV; seed spread
of the baseline (half range of three seeds) 0.01-0.07 GeV.

Reference values: published model (800k updates) 3.59 GeV; base run
(batch 32, 5e-5) 3.63 at 80k updates, 3.60 at 140k; median-rho subtraction
5.28; per-row oracle rho 5.09.

| target | val `jer_cal` | meaning |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **T_acc** (primary) | **<= 3.70 GeV** | published + 3%: indistinguishable from the baseline at the level of its seed spread |
| T_match | <= 3.65 GeV | published + 2 statistical errors |
| T_useful | <= 4.00 GeV | a clear gain over the median-rho reference (5.28) |

Time to a target: the first evaluation at which a run meets it, **confirmed
by the next evaluation**; otherwise "not reached within budget". Time is
the training-loop time on one RTX A6000 (dahlia or ceres; the baseline's
hours are on dahlia), GPU-synchronised, excluding evaluation; end-to-end
time (with start-up, data preparation and evaluation) is reported
separately. The baseline's time to each target is computed from its
checkpoint scores and `history.csv` by the same rule, once jobs
20040-20044 have ended.

### Candidates

Common: psi(E) standardised per channel with a mean and deviation fitted on
training events only; a compact time-conditioned U-Net (TorchCFM's ADM
`UNetModel`, native 24 x 64, three down-samplings, attention at 6 x 16);
Adam, EMA of the weights; the same batch for all; the ODE integrated with a
fixed-step solver so the number of network evaluations (NFE) is exact.

- **A. OT-CFM, unpaired, augmented state.** State x = (background, signal),
  2 x 24 x 64. Source x0 = (psi(m), psi(0)): a real mixture with all its
  energy in the background channel and an empty signal channel (the
  baseline's own embedding of a mixture, c.f. `idt-bb`). Target x1 =
  (psi(b), psi(s)), b and s drawn independently. Exact minibatch OT between
  independently drawn source and target batches (squared Euclidean in the
  standardised state; TorchCFM `ExactOptimalTransportConditionalFlowMatcher`,
  sigma 0); velocity v(t, x), no conditioning. Decoding: integrate from
  x0 of the test mixture; signal = channel 1 (direct), and as a second
  reading signal = mixture - channel 0 (additivity imposed at decoding).
  Differs from the published method: the source is a degenerate
  augmentation of a 1-channel distribution, and the coupling pairs
  mixtures with independently drawn component pairs.
- **B. SB-CFM, unpaired, augmented state.** Same endpoints and network.
  Entropic OT plan with reg = 2 sigma^2 (Sinkhorn, log domain), Brownian
  bridge interpolant and SB conditional velocity (TorchCFM
  `SchrodingerBridgeConditionalFlowMatcher`; the published entropic
  coupling rather than the library's default exact plan); sigma 1 in
  standardised units. Velocity only, sampled with the probability-flow
  ODE: this is SB-CFM, not SF2M (no score model, no SDE).
- **C. Conditional CFM on synthetic mixtures** (the follow-up if A and B
  fail on correspondence). x1 = (psi(b), psi(s)), x0 ~ N(0, I), condition
  psi(b + s) concatenated to the network input; the pairing is exact by
  construction, the coupling independent (I-CFM). Uses the additive mixing,
  as the baseline's `idt-aa` does. At test the condition is the real
  mixture. Stochastic: scored per single sample and as the mean of K
  samples, with the cost of each.
- **D. Regression control for C**: the same network, trained to output
  (psi(b), psi(s)) from psi(b + s) by mean squared error. Same information as
  C, no flow; a 1-step Euler solve of C at t = 0 would reproduce it.

### Budget

Pilot: one seed, at most 30 GPU-minutes of training per configuration, at
most two GPU-hours in total including diagnostics and evaluation, on A6000s.
Before the pilot: shapes, finite gradients, coupling behaviour (does the
minibatch coupling pair a mixture with a signal whose jet is where the
mixture's jet is -- scored with held-out truth, never trained on), and a
checkpoint save/load round trip. Configurations that look promising are
extended to longer runs and three seeds, capped by the baseline's own time
to T_acc (~10-15 GPU-hours per seed): a candidate that needs longer is not
faster.
